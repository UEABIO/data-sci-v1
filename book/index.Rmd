By the end of this book, you will be able to:

* Import data into R
* Manipulate and wrangle data into an appropriate format for analysis
* Calculate summaries of descriptive statistics
* Produce informative data visualisations
* Produce reports using R & Markdown
* Use GitHub to develop version control and data reproducibility skills
* Use General and Generalized Linear Models to produce mean estimates, uncertainty intervals and statistical tests. 

## How to use this book 

For many of the chapters, we will provide the code you need to use. You can copy and paste from the book, however, we strongly encourage you to type out the code by yourself. This will seem much slower and you will make errors, but you will learn much more quickly this way.

Additionally, we also provide the solutions to many of the activities. No-one is going to check whether you tried to figure it out yourself rather than going straight to the solution but remember this: if you copy and paste without thinking, you will learn nothing. 

Finally, on occasion we will make updates to the book such as fixing typos and including additional detail or activities and as such this book should be considered a living document. Please **tell me** if you find any mistakes. 

## Course Structure

We have:

* one lecture per week
* one workshop per week

These are both timetabled in-person sessions, and you should check (Timetabler)[https://timetabler.uea.ac.uk/] for up to-date information on scheduling. However, all lessons can be accessed remotely through Collaborate, and everything you need to complete workshops will be available on this site.

If you feel unwell, or cannot attend a session in-person because you need to self-isolate then donâ€™t worry you can access everything, and follow along in real time, or work at your own pace.

Questions/issues/errors can all be posted on our (Yammer)[https://www.yammer.com/uea.ac.uk/] page.

### Workshops

The workshops are the best way to learn, they teach you the practical skills you need to become an R wizard.

### Lectures

Lectures will be recorded, but Q&A and interactions will be best achieved if you can attend in-person. If you have any worries or concerns about your ability to attend in-person teaching sessions please let me know.
